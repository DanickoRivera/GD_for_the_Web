victims the United States has a
00:04
problem with gun violence we hold the
00:07
<b>victims in our hearts perhaps we may
00:09
never fully understand it we talk about
00:12
	it after mass shootings</b> but it's much
00:14
larger and more complicated than those
00:16
	debates allow here's what you need to
00:20
know about the state of gun violence in
00:22
America it's true that the <b>u.s. sees
00:24
many more mass shootings than these
00:26
	other developed countries</b> between 2000
00:29
and 2014 there were <b>133 mass shootings
00:32
	in public populated places</b> that's
00:34
excluding gang violence and terrorism of
00:37
course the u.s. is a much larger country
00:38
but if you adjust for population size it
00:40
	<b>still ranks higher of these countries</b>
00:43
Finland is next with just two shootings
00:45
over 14 years but a much much smaller
00:47
population and this type of tragedy
00:50
seems to be happening more often in the
00:52
u.s. each of these squares represents a
00:54
<b>public mass shooting with four or more
00:56
	fatalities before 2011</b> they happened six
01:00
months apart on average but since then
01:03
only two months go by between them I
01:07
hope and pray that I don't have to come
01:10
out again during my tenure as president
01:16
talk to my condolences to families in
01:18
these circumstances that was October 1st
01:21
2015 and just about two months later
01:24
yesterday tragically our first senator
01:32
<b>thousand prayers to the families public
01:36
	mass shootings</b> get all the attention
01:38
because they're often so indiscriminate
01:40
but the truth is mass shootings are
01:42
unlike most gun deaths in America here's
01:45
how it breaks down according to the most
01:47
recent data<b> 92 people are killed with
01:49
	guns every day</b> on average about 30 of
01:52
those or homicides of which maybe one
01:54
and a half at most can be considered
01:56
part of mass shootings
01:57
most of those kill 58 people a day are
01:59
suicides the rest are accidental
02:02
shootings police actions and
02:05
undetermined incidents those suicides
02:09
they show up in international
02:10
comparisons - these are the 10 countries
02:13
ranked highest on human development by
02:15
the UN the US has the highest suicide
02:17
rate among them and this darker bar
02:20
shows how many of those are with guns
02:22
some people think suicide isn't really
02:25
relevant to the gun issue but to go and
02:27
think that some type of gun control
02:29
regulations that are being talked about
02:31
are going to stop somebody from
02:32
committing suicide when there's so many
02:34
other ways for people commit suicide but
02:37
the methods that people use are
02:39
important because suicide attempts often
02:41
stem from temporary crises the vast
02:44
majority of people who survived suicide
02:46
attempts don't end up dying from suicide
02:48
but <b>guns make it nearly impossible to
02:50
get that second chance the victims of
02:53
	gun suicides</b> are overwhelmingly men and
02:56
mostly white
02:59
and the rate of gun suicides has been
03:02
increasing in the u.s. at the same time
03:06
the rate of gun homicides has been
03:08
decreasing especially since the 90s when
03:10
crime rates in general were higher but
03:13
if you compare the u.s. to other
03:14
developed countries it doesn't look like
03:16
good news these are <b> homicides adjusted
03:19
	for population</b> size the US would
03:21
probably have a higher homicide rate
03:22
even without guns but you can see how
03:25
gun violence pushes that rate far beyond
03:27
the other countries here the victims of
03:30
these shootings they're not the ones you
03:32
often see on the national news they're
03:34
disproportionately young black men you
03:38
guys can leave here to go on with your
03:39
lives we gotta go on to empty roads
03:43
because I choose your lives were taken
03:45
away by people who should not have had
03:47
<b>guns anyway one possible explanation is
03:50
that the u.s. simply has more crime than
03:53
	those other countries</b> but if you set
03:55
aside homicides for a moment and look at
03:57
rates of burglary or assault you don't
04:01
see that same spike that you see with
04:03
homicide it's not that America has much
04:07
more crime it's that crime in the u.s.
04:10
is much more lethal altogether the
04:14
number of<b>gun deaths in the u.s. from
04:15
2000 to 2013 exceeds the number of
04:18
Americans killed by AIDS by illegal drug
04:21
overdoses the Iraq and Afghanistan wars
04:24
	and terrorism combined</b> it should be
04:28
clear by now that this level of gun
04:29
	violence is a<b>uniquely American</b> problem
04:31
among the developed world and here's one
04:34
reason why there are a ton of guns in
04:37
the US this chart shows the estimated
04:39
number of guns by country it's adjusted
04:41
for population size and it's still not
04:43
even close question that I would like to
04:46
ask you is is how on earth could he
04:50
compile 13 guns how can that happen if
04:55
you take a look back at the 10 countries
04:57
with the highest levels of human
04:58
development you can see that it's
05:00
relatively really easy to get a gun in
05:02
the US all of the other countries
05:04
require a license to purchase most guns
05:06
and those purchases are recorded into an
05:08
official registry to get that license
05:10
people have to state a reason for why
05:12
they want a gun and in most of these
05:14
countries they have to pass a safety
05:16
test and are required by law to store
05:18
their guns safely in part because of its
05:20
lacks laws there are well over 300
05:22
million guns in the US and Counting
05:25
this chart doesn't reflect private sales
05:27
but it shows the<b>number of background
05:29
	checks</b> which all federally licensed
05:32
dealers have to run it suggests that the
05:34
demand for guns has been increasing
05:35
steeply since Barack Obama took office
05:38
so we've looked at gun deaths and at gun
05:40
ownership
05:41
this chart puts them together it shows
05:44
that among highly developed countries
05:45
<b>the more guns in a country the more gun
05:48
	deaths</b> you can see that countries like
05:50
Switzerland which have relatively more
05:52
guns than a country like the Netherlands
05:53
also have a higher gun death rate and
05:56
here's the u.s. likewise u.s. states
06:01
with more guns have more gun homicides
06:03
there are outliers like Idaho which has
06:06
higher rates of gun ownership but low
06:07
	rates of <b>gun murders</b> but overall there's
06:10
a <b>correlation between gun ownership and
06:12
homicide rates and that relationship has
06:15
	held up in studies</b> that control for
06:17
things like poverty unemployment and
06:18
crime the correlation between gun
06:21
ownership and gun deaths is even
06:23
stronger for suicides
06:25
it makes sense depression with a gun is
06:28
more dangerous than depression without
06:30
one likewise <b>fights domestic disputes
06:33
road rage drunkenness all much more
06:36
	dangerous with a gun</b> than without
06:38
that said you might need different
06:40
policies to keep guns away from
06:42
potential mass shooters than you would
06:44
to keep them out of inner-city gangs or
06:46
out of the hands of someone who might
06:48
hurt themselves <b>America doesn't have a
06:50
gun problem it has several of them.</b>

	00:00
hi everybody's tatin molyneux from
00:01
freedomain radio hope you're doing well
00:02
hey I've got a great idea
00:04
why don't we get some <i>actual facts into
00:06
	the mix when it comes to gun control</i>
00:08
because the amount of lying falsehoods
00:10
misinformation sophistry and whatnot in
00:13
<i>the gun control debate is truly
00:15
staggering if not downright of biblical
00:17
	proportions</i> we're going to cut through
00:19
all of that clutter with some original
00:21
research that will show you the actual
00:23
facts about gun control and when you see
00:26
the actual facts about gun control
00:27
you'll see why nobody wants to talk
00:30
about it but let's dive straight in to
00:32
the data so in gun control a litmus test
00:36
of somebody's honesty when discussing
00:38
the data is whether they talk about
00:40
<i>homicides or gun deaths now gun deaths
00:43
of course are any death that results
00:44
from the use of a gun as you can see
00:46
from this chart 2012 data sixty-two
00:50
percent of gun deaths in the United
00:52
States are suicides</i> hmm that seems quite
00:55
important only 35 percent of them or
00:57
homicides mixing these two together is
01:00
lying and of course that's quite a lot
01:03
of what occurs in this area suicides of
01:05
course doing unto yourself homicides
01:06
doing unto others if doing to yourself
01:09
is exactly the same as doing unto others
01:10
I was a total stud in junior high school
01:13
that's why I got carpal tunnel syndrome
01:14
so now now maybe you say well <i>let's ban
01:18
gun so that there are fewer suicides</i>
01:20
because they're used a lot in suicides
01:22
well the data denies you there I'm
01:24
afraid you are fact blocked in the
01:27
<i>United States fifty-one percent of
01:29
suicides are achieved with a firearm 24
01:31
percent by hanging or suffocation</i> now in
01:34
the United Kingdom where handguns are
01:36
generally banned only 2 percent of
01:38
suicides are achieved through firearms
01:41
but 60 percent through hanging or
01:43
suffocation just think of society like a
01:45
balloon you know you push in one end
01:47
the other end just bulges out <i> get rid of
01:49
guns people would kill themselves some
01:50
	other way</i>
01:51
ah ha you may say but the United Kingdom
01:53
has only half the suicide rate of the
01:56
United States that is true however if we
01:59
go to South Korea which has the second
02:01
highest suicide rate in the world and
02:03
where handguns are banned people kill
02:06
themselves 60 percent of the time using
02:08
pesticides so it doesn't really matter
02:10
<i>people want to kill themselves are going
02:12
to find a way to kill themselves</i>
02:13
why's its van bridges and then we've got
02:16
to get very wet so let's look at how
02:21
criminals get guns see if you make guns
02:24
illegal people who don't follow the law
02:26
might still get a hold of them and then
02:29
why do people even need to ask this
02:31
question hey remember how they banned
02:32
marijuana and how it's impossible to get
02:34
marijuana and therefore there is no such
02:36
thing as a Cheech and Chong film yeah I
02:38
didn't think so they can't even keep
02:39
drugs out of prison so you turn all of
02:41
society into a prison people are still
02:43
going to find a way to get what they
02:44
want so this was a survey of inmates and
02:48
Firearms sources 40% came from illegal
02:51
sources and that's theft drug dealer off
02:53
the street and so on
02:56
thirty-seven point four percent of
02:58
inmates got that gun from family or
03:00
friend because you know what kind of
03:02
friend are you if you let your criminal
03:04
friend wander around unarmed a bad
03:06
friend I guess
03:07
<i>11.3 got those through illegal purchase
03:10
in other words they went through a
03:11
background check point eight percent got
03:13
them get from gun shows</i> where background
03:15
checks are usually not performed and
03:16
11.2% got them from other so you really
03:22
not going to do much good by banning
03:23
guns let's look at Australia in 1996 the
03:29
Australian government introduced very
03:31
strict gun control legislation after two
03:34
things one a massacre in Tasmania and
03:35
two realizing that most people that are
03:37
descended from criminals so let's take
03:39
them away now firearm homicides did
03:41
decline sharply immediately afterwards
03:43
but overall homicide rates did not
03:45
change until 2001 when they began to
03:48
trend downwards as part of a worldwide
03:50
trend of a reduction of this kind of
03:53
violence now as you can see from the
03:56
graph as firearm use in homicides
03:58
declined the use of knives and other
04:00
sharp objects increased now shockingly
04:03
there is pretty good data to suggest
04:06
that you're about as likely to die from
04:09
a knife wound as you are from a gunshot
04:10
wound especially handguns they're pretty
04:12
small so yeah it doesn't really solve
04:15
the problem you just get more knives and
04:17
sharp instruments being used to kill
04:18
people rather than firearms now
04:22
according to the <i>theory more guns is
04:25
more crime</i> and therefore if we want
04:27
reduce crime less guns okay let's put
04:30
that to the test it's not really a very
04:32
complicated test but we'll do it anyway
04:33
us homicide rate from 1994 to 2012
04:38
declines from nine to a little under
04:40
five so that must mean that the number
04:43
of ganz has been declining enormous Lee
04:45
right no way more guns now than there
04:49
were in 1994 and a far lower homicide
04:52
rate so according to one estimate 286
04:54
million guns in the u.s. in 2011 other
04:57
estimates placed at as high as 334
05:00
million which is more guns than people
05:03
so this data should give anyone pause
05:06
when it cam they wanna say this is
05:08
correlation nobody's saying there's
05:10
direct causation here that there are
05:11
arguments that the more prevalent their
05:13
<i>guns are the less light less safe
05:16
criminals feel and the fewer crimes are
05:18
committed and there are estimates that
05:19
say that as many as two and a half
05:20
million crimes in the US are prevented
05:22
because people are armed</i> but this should
05:26
give you pause if you think that
05:27
reducing guns will automatically reduce
05:29
homicides because there seems to be some
05:32
other factor at play here all right if
05:37
we think that more guns is more
05:39
homicides let's look at the top states
05:43
by murder rate let's count the District
05:45
of Columbia as a stage rather the center
05:47
of evil so let's compare gun ownership
05:50
this is from 2002 so the national
05:53
average gun ownership percentage thirty
05:54
two point six percent of people murder
05:57
rate per 100,000 five point six for now
06:00
the <i>District of Columbia has very very
06:04
few guns and it's only five point two
06:07
percent gun ownership which is way way
06:10
less met six times less than the
06:11
national average so therefore the murder
06:14
rate should be totally low according to
06:16
the theory not the case the murder rate
06:17
is far higher in the District of
06:19
Columbia</i> that it is nationally eight
06:22
times nine times higher
06:23
despite a five point two percent gun
06:25
ownership percentage it's a forty six
06:28
point two murder rate per 100,000
06:30
Louisiana boy that's high gun ownership
06:33
forty five point six Oh murder rate much
06:37
lower than District of Columbia which
06:38
has a much
06:39
or firearm or gun ownership right <i>13.2
06:43
Maryland 22.1% gun ownership 9.4%
06:47
homicide mississippi 54.3% gun ownership
06:53
hey those frogs aren't going to shoot
06:55
themselves and 9.2 percent
06:57
murder rate and no correlation there
06:58
nevada 31.5% gun ownership murder rate
07:03
per 100,000 8.3 and if you take out the
07:07
back alleys behind casinos that's a lot</i>
07:09
lower New Mexico 39.6% gun ownership 8.3
07:15
percent murder rate Illinois 19.7 gun
07:18
ownership 7.5% murder rate South
07:20
Carolina 45% gun ownership rate 7.3
07:23
percent murder rate 7.3 sorry murder
07:25
rate per 100,000 Tennessee forty six
07:28
point four to seven point two Arizona
07:30
thirty six point two to seven point one
07:32
so as you can see no particular
07:34
correlation so <i>firearms control
07:41
regulations Act of 1975 banned
07:44
Washington DC residents from owning
07:46
handguns automatic firearms and
07:48
high-capacity semi-automatic firearms
07:50
about ten years later crime in DC began
07:53
to skyrocket and by the 1990s the area
07:56
became known as the murder capital of
07:58
the United States</i> now of course there
08:01
was a crack epidemic in the 80s but here
08:04
we see there's a <i>firearm ban doesn't
08:05
seem to have much to do with the murder
08:07
rate and then the murder rate skyrockets
08:09
despite the firearm ban</i> hmm something
08:12
else at play here as to why the murder
08:17
rate began to decline in the 90s well
08:20
there's a <i>number of arguments stronger
08:22
sentencing and not letting criminals out
08:24
you know in the 1960s</i> there was kind of
08:27
a revolving door policy put in by the
08:29
leftists which was you know well
08:31
criminals or victims and it's
08:32
socioeconomic status and Marxist
08:34
economic determinism so let's let the
08:36
poor people out and the poor criminals
08:38
out and therefore they went and
08:39
committed more crimes also there's an
08:41
argument to be made that the
08:43
legalization of abortion in the 1970s 16
08:47
to 20 years later produced far fewer
08:48
feral young men raised in fatherless
08:51
homes and their form
08:52
higher propensity towards criminality so
08:57
doesn't really matter murder rate and
09:01
gun ownership by state let's list all
09:03
the states and the murder rate and gun
09:07
ownership a Senate on the y-axis here
09:08
the higher the gun ownership you'd
09:10
expect the higher the murder rate it's
09:11
not the case there's a slightly negative
09:14
correlation so one point zero is a
09:17
perfect correlation minus one point zero
09:20
is a perfectly negative correlation zero
09:22
is no correlation doll this is basically
09:24
zero there is no relationship between
09:27
gun ownership by state and the motor
09:29
rates so reducing gun ownership will
09:31
have no particular effect on the murder
09:33
rate I wonder if there's another
09:36
correlation yes I think there is hang on
09:38
to your hats firearm motor rate and gun
09:41
ownership by state so gun ownership and
09:45
firearm <i>murder rate so even when there
09:47
are lots of guns our guns used to kill
09:50
people not really correlation of minus
09:52
zero point zero seven nothing</i>
09:54
particularly significant so this is not
09:57
the pattern that we're looking for
09:59
stormtrooper let's compare Baltimore
10:03
Maryland sorry Baltimore Memphis and
10:05
Portland so the national average four
10:09
point five per 100,000 2014 Baltimore
10:13
had a murder rate of thirty three point
10:15
eight for one hundred thousand now
10:17
Maryland has very strict gun control
10:19
laws very high murder rate the same year
10:22
Memphis also had a murder rate of twenty
10:24
one point four compared to the four
10:26
point five national average now
10:28
Tennessee gun control laws are a lot
10:30
less restrictive compared to Maryland
10:32
murder rate is also very high close to
10:35
four times the national average
10:37
Portland four point two murder rate
10:40
which is even below the national average
10:42
for one hundred thousand now Oregon's
10:44
gun control laws not particularly
10:47
different from Tennessee why is there
10:50
such a big difference could it be that
10:52
gun control policies have very little
10:54
effect on murder rates a CDC analysis
11:00
performed in 2003 a fifty-one gun
11:03
control studies quote found insufficient
11:05
evidence
11:05
to determine the effectiveness of any of
11:07
the firearms laws reviewed for
11:09
preventing violence the results were all
11:13
over the place
11:14
so if you're trying to control guns you
11:17
will not be able to control murder but
11:20
there's another factor brace yourself
11:22
it's coming let's look at homicide rates
11:25
by race this may shock you this may
11:28
appalled you please don't shoot the
11:29
messenger these are just the facts and
11:31
we're talking about races because races
11:34
or ethnicities act in a different way so
11:36
we have to <i>talk about</i> them in a
11:37
different way and we don't want to be
11:39
averse to fact the numbers do we that
11:41
would be psychotic and insane so per
11:45
100,000 people sixteen point two seven
11:50
homicide rates among blacks 5.2 four
11:52
among Hispanics 1.7 for among whites and
11:56
0.95% among Asians so blacks have well
12:01
over nine times the homicide rate of
12:03
whites Hispanics about three times and
12:05
of course Asians a little more than half
12:08
this is from 2014 the numbers were
12:11
fairly obscure prior to that because
12:13
until 2013 crime statistics tended to
12:15
blend Hispanics in with whites now that
12:18
has been broken out so so let's look at
12:23
the top ten cities by moderate earlier
12:25
we were talking about gun ownership
12:28
versus murder rate here we'll talk about
12:29
top ten cities by murder rate we'll look
12:31
at the black population as a percentage
12:33
and the murder rate per 100,000 now the
12:37
national average for the black
12:38
population about 13% of the US
12:40
population again murder rate per 100,000
12:42
2014 four point five st. Louis forty
12:46
nine percent black and forty nine point
12:49
nine put 100,000 murder rate well that's
12:52
more than ten times that's very high
12:54
Detroit eighty three percent black forty
12:56
three point five murder rate sir New
12:59
Orleans sixty percent black thirty eight
13:00
point eight sixty four percent black in
13:03
Baltimore and a thirty three point eight
13:05
murder rate fifty two percent black
13:07
Newark New Jersey thirty three point
13:09
three murder rate so there seems to be a
13:12
bit more of a correlation there
13:14
<i>Birmingham Alabama seventy three percent
13:16
black twenty four point five murder rate
13:19
Buffalo
13:19
New York 39 percent black 23.2 murder
13:22
rate 55 percent black Baton Rouge 23.1
13:26
murder rate in Pittsburgh 26 percent
13:29
black 22.4 murder is possibly the worst
13:32
of all Memphis Tennessee 63 percent
13:35
black 21 point for murder rate</i>
13:37
Pittsburgh recorded 66 killings in 2014
13:41
that's more than any year since 2008
13:43
when the officials counted 79 a lot of
13:47
this according to officials is is in the
13:48
drug trade more evidence of heroin and
13:51
cheap drug use and cheap drug sales on
13:54
the street of the 66 homicide victims in
13:57
the city 59 were black and only seven
13:59
were white and this is not in any way
14:04
hostile towards the black population of
14:06
course given that ninety percent of the
14:09
murders committed by blacks or other
14:10
blacks were actually here in the realm
14:12
of black lives matter but we have to
14:13
start talking about the facts and the
14:15
truth in order to begin solving the
14:17
problem people say oh you see but it's
14:21
because blacks are disproportionately
14:24
high in their gang membership and that's
14:26
why there's this high murder rate well
14:29
certainly is true that blacks and
14:31
Hispanics are let's just say
14:34
disproportionately represented among
14:35
<i>gang members Hispanics have a higher
14:37
rate of gang membership than blacks
14:40
Hispanics hovering between 45 and 50
14:43
percent blacks between 30 and just under
14:46
40 percent in terms of this is the
14:49
proportion of gang members by race</i>
14:51
White's hovering around 10 percent now
14:53
Hispanics I don't know why they're
14:54
higher my guess would be you know
14:55
spanish-speaking connections through
14:57
Mexico tunnels under the border and so
14:59
on a lot of human trafficking some drug
15:01
traffic in trafficking and so on and so
15:05
it is not because blacks are
15:07
disproportionately represented in gangs
15:09
that we have such a high murder rate
15:10
it's something else now it certainly is
15:16
true that use of firearms is incredibly
15:18
common in gang-related homicides but
15:20
remember Hispanics have a much lower
15:22
homicide rate than blacks despite being
15:23
more in gangs gangs are responsible
15:26
according to FBI data for an average of
15:28
forty eight percent of violent crime in
15:30
most jurisdictions and up to ninety
15:32
percent in several other
15:33
however according to the United States
15:35
national gang Center which tranqs gang
15:38
activities gang-related homicides
15:40
account for only 13% of all homicides
15:42
annually so blacks can't be because of
15:45
gang membership because their gang
15:46
membership is lower than Hispanic and
15:48
gang homicides don't contribute that
15:50
much to the national average so this is
15:57
all original research this part and
15:59
comes from listener donations so if you
16:01
find this information valuable if you
16:02
appreciate the clarity we're bringing to
16:05
this topic please go to
16:06
freedomainradio.com slash donate so we
16:08
can continue to help out communities in
16:11
trouble by bringing the facts of their
16:13
difficulties to the general public so
16:16
this is they set for this slide and the
16:19
following slides all cities with
16:21
populations over 200,000 that have FBI
16:23
crime data available so here on the
16:26
y-axis that's the one on the left going
16:28
up e down e the population of the city
16:31
that is white the percentage of the
16:34
population that is white from 0 to 90%
16:37
is the high end and the murder rate and
16:40
so here we can see a negative
16:42
correlation in other words the more
16:44
White's who live in a city the lower the
16:46
murder rate tends to become that's a
16:48
pretty significant correlation so now
16:54
we're starting to get somewhere in terms
16:55
of data that actually has correlations
16:57
murder rate and Hispanic population by
17:00
city there is a mildly negative
17:02
correlation of minus 0.16 now given that
17:06
Hispanics have a higher murder rate than
17:08
whites it's hard to know exactly why
17:10
this is the case I way to your comments
17:12
and questions below but here the more
17:15
Hispanics are in the city the lower the
17:18
murder rate it could be because they're
17:20
pushing out blacks who have a higher
17:22
<i>murder rate it's hard to say but this is
17:24
the fact
17:24
and now the not so deadly Chinatown the
17:30
murder rate an Asian population by city
17:31
a negative correlation of minus 0.2 7</i> in
17:35
other words the more Asians who live in
17:36
your city
17:37
the fewer murders you are likely to
17:39
experience which of course we would
17:40
expect given that they have a very very
17:42
low murder rate so here we see the
17:45
things which negatively correlated
17:47
with murder the more Hispanics and
17:50
whites and Asian's who are living in
17:51
your city the lower your murder rate
17:52
will generally tend to become now we
17:55
come to the launch pad of tragedy this
17:58
is the murder rate and black population
17:59
by city so now we're starting to get
18:01
some data that we can begin to use to
18:03
make <i>appalling horrified yet intelligent
18:07
and informed decisions about how to
18:08
solve problems related to gun violence
18:11
the correlation between the back black
18:14
population in the city and the murder
18:15
rate is 0.77 that is extremely high that
18:20
is extremely high and here you can see
18:23
as the black population as a percentage</i>
18:25
of the city goes up the murder rate goes
18:27
up as well and this explains of course
18:29
things like Asian flight and Jewish
18:31
flight and white flight and so on is
18:32
that generally when the blacks move into
18:34
the neighborhood again the majority of
18:36
blacks very nice people law-abiding and
18:39
so on however there is a toxicity to the
18:41
black culture that has been of course
18:43
identified by people like Tom Sol and
18:45
Walter Williams and Shelby Steele and so
18:47
on where they point out that there is a
18:49
toxic anti learning anti assimilation
18:52
hatred of the dominant class structure
18:55
and what is called institutionalized
18:58
racism so there's a hostility towards
18:59
the dominant culture there is a massive
19:01
amounts of single motherhood close to
19:03
three-quarters of black kids born
19:05
outside of wedlock and that is
19:06
associated strongly with increased
19:08
criminality so for whatever reason and
19:11
we're going to delve more into this in
19:12
our presentation the truth about crime
19:13
but for whatever reason right now these
19:16
are the facts that the higher the
19:18
population of blacks in a city the
19:20
higher the murder rate becomes in a very
19:22
or at least significantly linear fashion
19:25
oh it's poverty you say see it's it's
19:29
it's the poor people and because poverty
19:31
therefore crime no this is this is the
19:34
go-to position for people who wish to
19:36
avoid uncomfortable facts but it is
19:38
false the correlation between murder and
19:41
the poverty rate for this from 1960 to
19:43
2014 is - 0.44 in other words as poverty
19:49
goes down the murder rate goes up this
19:53
is the exact opposite of everything that
19:55
people talk about let me say this again
19:57
is really important understand as the
19:58
poverty rate declines the murder rate
20:00
goes up if you look back in the past
20:04
when the poverty rate was hovering
20:06
around 22% murder rate was less than
20:09
five now we've got poverty 8 to 12
20:12
percent 10 to 12 percent we've got a
20:14
murder rate of 10 plus in general so
20:19
this is the exact opposite of what
20:21
everyone is told and the reasons for
20:24
this this is not causal right it's not
20:25
like if you <i>make more people poor the
20:27
crime rate will go down that's not
20:28
necessarily proven in this it could be a
20:32
commonality</i> with with other factors so
20:35
in the 1960s the welfare state came in
20:37
and the welfare state promoted single
20:40
motherhood single motherhood promotes
20:42
criminality so that could be as the
20:43
poverty rate declines as the result of
20:45
government payments to single mothers
20:46
the criminality goes up because the
20:49
children of single mothers are much more
20:50
likely to become criminals so there of
20:52
course as the welfare state came in
20:54
there with leniency towards criminals
20:55
and so that may be another ko joining
20:57
factor so this is correlation this is
21:00
not proof of causation
21:01
however the argument that we simply give
21:04
more money to poor people and they're a
21:05
stop committing crimes not only is that
21:07
kind of like a shakedown like let's pay
21:09
you to not commit crimes it's kind of
21:10
like what the Mafia does when they
21:11
threatened to burn down your restaurant
21:12
but it is not borne out by the facts and
21:16
all you have to do is look at the crime
21:17
rate of appalachia a section of America
21:20
with significantly lower incomes and
21:23
realize that their motor rate is very
21:25
low as well violent crime and poverty
21:31
rate the correlation here is even more
21:34
strong but negative so as the poverty
21:37
rate declines the violent crime rate
21:39
increases increase is minus 0.5 to again
21:43
this is 1960 to 2014 so simply saying
21:47
well <i>if we reduce the poverty rate we
21:48
will reduce the crime no it's not
21:51
uncorrelated it is negatively correlated
21:53
the lower the poverty rate the higher of
21:55
the violent crime it's even worse for
21:59
property crime and poverty rates</i> as the
22:02
poverty rate declines property crime
22:04
shoots through the roof the correlation
22:06
is minus 0.5 9 that is staggeringly
22:10
appallingly horrible
22:12
so this compares overall property crime
22:13
rates
22:14
poverty for each year between 1960 and
22:16
2014 so the normal place is the natural
22:20
places where people look for answers
22:21
with regards to gun violence and gun
22:23
control are false or incorrect
22:27
now of course you may be asking yourself
22:30
what is the answer well we're we're
22:33
working on it and we are putting
22:34
together presentations truth that crime
22:36
where we go into we have some in
22:37
tentative theses which we're working on
22:39
trying to get out to you but again we
22:41
rely on your donations
22:41
freedomainradio.com / donate to help us
22:45
out so I mean let's just talk honesty
22:49
everybody says well we want a real
22:50
conversation about gun control we want
22:51
real conversations about race but then
22:53
when you bring data some people are like
22:54
oh no too much reality well sorry but we
22:57
need to bring facts because we need
22:58
people to have the correct information
23:00
when they are talking about things like
23:02
gun control America does not have a
23:04
problem with gun control America it
23:06
seems has a problem with violence within
23:08
the black community and within the
23:10
Hispanic community but good job Asians
23:12
at not shooting people now of course I
23:15
like you like every other decent person
23:18
in the world
23:18
once less violence less crime less
23:20
homicides fewer thefts and so on but
23:23
that requires that we first address
23:24
where the problems are really occurring
23:26
which is in the black community to a
23:28
large degree in the United States and
23:30
lots of black leaders who agree with me
23:31
so these are just facts we do want fewer
23:35
black bodies hitting the floor hiding
23:37
the relationship between blacks and
23:40
crime is even worse than hiding the
23:42
relationship between smoking and lung
23:43
cancer because smoking you do to
23:45
yourself but you think of these poor
23:47
<i>black kids who are shot and drive-by
23:49
shootings and gun gang violence and so
23:50
on have to grow up with bars and the
23:52
windows</i> and so on it is a tragic and
23:54
horrifying life and it's not just
23:56
because of poverty there are other
23:57
issues at play toxic culture has been
23:59
identified by a lot of black
24:00
intellectuals as to why there's so much
24:03
violence in the black community single
24:05
motherhood is another factor that's been
24:06
identified by wide variety of thinkers
24:08
there are other factors which we're
24:09
going to work in our next presentation
24:12
so the <i> reality is that gun control is an
24:18
illusion it's an illusion currently
24:20
masked by a deception</i> in that everyone
24:21
pretending is pretending that everyone
24:23
in America is somehow the same
24:25
but gun control is an illusion <i>there is
24:28
nobody who is for gun control in any
24:31
kind of absolute fashion this is a
24:34
something I wrote years ago which I
24:36
stand by as strongly</i> if not more
24:38
strongly now than when I first wrote it
24:40
if you are for gun control then you are
24:45
not against guns because the guns will
24:47
be needed to disarm the people so<i> it's
24:51
not that you are anti-gun you need the
24:55
police's guns to take away other
24:56
people's guns so you are very pro-gun
25:01
you just believe that only the
25:02
government which is of course so
25:04
reliable honest moral and virtuous</i>
25:06
should be allowed to have guns there is
25:11
no such thing as gun control there is
25:15
only centralizing gun ownership in the
25:20
hands of a small political elite and
25:24
their minions and if you think that is a
25:29
safe approach to take I've got a quarter
25:32
of a billion dead people in the 20th
25:35
century alone outside of war<i> murdered by
25:37
their own governments almost exclusively
25:40
after having been disarmed first mostly
25:45
by lies</i>
